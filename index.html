        <p class="personal-intro">
          My name is Joseph Jameson-Rickard and I come from England but currently live in Norway. My biggest passion in life is running and I am constantly pushing myself to improve and run faster times. Outside of running, I travel as much as possible and love exploring new countries and cities. In June 2022, my wife and I visited 4 countries in 5 days, and a year later covered 12 countries and 19 towns/cities in 27 days around Europe in our biggest trip to date.<br>
          I currently work as a pizza baker while studying Web and Software Development at BYU Idaho. I graduated as a Sports Therapist and Rehabilitator before moving to Norway where the degree is not accepted. I look forward to developing my web dev skills to the point I can get my foot in the door in the tech industry, and have many ideas for personal projects that I am excited to build.

        <p class="flag-caption britflag">Official Flag of the United Kingdom</p>
        <p class="country-description1">Kent, the most south-eastern part of the United Kingdom, is also known as the "Garden of England" due to its greenery. England is most known for its staple meal of fish and chips, the red phone boxes, being a footballing nation, and of course the Royal Family.</p>
        <h4 class="oslo-title">Oslo, Norway</h4>
        <img class="flag-img norflag" alt="Norwegian flag" src="./images/norwegianflag.webp">
        <p class="flag-caption norflagtitle">Official Flag of Norway</p>
        <p class="country-description2">Norway is known for vikings, tall people, the northern lights, midnight sun in the summer and 24 hours of darkness in the winter. Norway also has a royal family but they love integrating with the people so it is normal to randomly see the Crown Princess on a public bus, or the Queen at the mall. A well-known motto of the Norwegians is that 'there is no bad weather, just bad clothes.', which is hard to believe when temperatures are below 0 Celcius and ice can be present for a good 5-6 months during a bad winter.</p>
