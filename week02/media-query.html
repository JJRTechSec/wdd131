        <h2>Matthew 5:14-16</h2>
        <p>Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on a hill cannot be hid.<br>Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick, and it giveth light unto all that are in the house.<br>Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.</p>
